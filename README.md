# Intro to Sass

## Description
The purpose of this repo is to learn some of the basics of Sass/SCSS and discover some of its features that CSS
is not able to do. This includes some similarities to Javascript, such as creating variables, nesting elements, and functions. 

This repo followed a tutorial by [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM&t=974s)
